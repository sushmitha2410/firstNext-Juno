# Juno
Juno is a clone of Notion which is created using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and APIs like Convex, Clerk and EdgeStore for the backend. It imitates many features of Notion and has user interface exactly like that of Notion's. It is a fully functional web application that can also handle 404 errors.
